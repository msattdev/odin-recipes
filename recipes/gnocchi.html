    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    Imagine a soup that is a hug in a bowl, a creamy and comforting masterpiece that warms you from the inside out. This is that gnocchi soup. At the heart of this recipe is a velvety, rich broth, a savory foundation built from a gentle simmer of aromatic vegetables like sweet carrots, tender celery, and mild onions. A touch of garlic and a whisper of fragrant herbs like thyme and rosemary weave their way through, creating a captivating aroma that will fill your kitchen and beckon everyone to the table. Swimming in this luscious, cream-kissed broth are the stars of the show: pillowy, tender potato gnocchi. These soft, delicate dumplings are like little bites of heaven, soaking up the flavorful soup and offering a delightful, melt-in-your-mouth texture in every spoonful.But the symphony of flavors and textures doesn't end there. Wilted spinach or kale adds a beautiful ribbon of color and a wholesome earthiness, while optional additions like savory Italian sausage or tender, shredded chicken can transform this into a truly hearty and satisfying one-pot meal. Each bite is a delightful interplay of creamy, savory, and tender, a culinary experience that is both elegant and deeply comforting.Finished with a generous sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan cheese that melts lazily into the warm soup and a grinding of black pepper, this gnocchi soup is more than just a recipeâ€”it's an invitation to slow down, savor the moment, and indulge in pure, delicious comfort.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Butter</li>
        <li>1 lb Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts, cooked and shredded or diced (a rotisserie chicken works beautifully for a shortcut!)</li>
        <li>1 cup Yellow Onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2/3 cup Celery, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2/3 cup Carrots, shredded or finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves Garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp Dried Thyme</li>
        <li>6 tbsp All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>Salt and Freshly Ground Black Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>4 cups Chicken Broth, low sodium recommended</li>
        <li>2 cups Half-and-Half (or 1 cup milk + 1 cup heavy cream for a richer soup)</li>
        <li>1 (16-ounce) package Potato Gnocchi (shelf-stable or refrigerated)</li>
        <li>3 cups Fresh Spinach, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the olive oil and butter.</li>
        <li>Once the butter has melted, add the chopped onion, celery, and carrots. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened and the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the minced garlic and dried thyme. Cook for another minute until fragrant. Be careful not to let the garlic burn.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the all-purpose flour over the softened vegetables. Stir continuously for about 1-2 minutes to cook out the raw flour taste. This mixture will be thick and pasty.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the chicken broth, whisking constantly as you add it. Pouring slowly and whisking will prevent any lumps from forming. Continue to whisk until the broth is smooth.</li>
        <li>Bring the soup to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, allowing the broth to thicken nicely.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and slowly stir in the half-and-half. Continue to stir until it's well combined. Do not let the soup boil after adding the dairy, as it can cause it to curdle.</li>
        <li>Stir the cooked, shredded chicken into the soup.</li>
        <li>Add the potato gnocchi directly to the pot. Stir gently.</li>
        <li>Let the soup simmer over medium-low heat for 3-5 minutes, or until the gnocchi are cooked through and have floated to the top. They will be plump and tender.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat. Stir in the chopped fresh spinach. The residual heat from the soup will wilt it perfectly in just a minute or two.</li>
        <li>Taste the soup and season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper until the flavors are just right.</li>
        <li>Ladle the hot soup into bowls.</li>
        <li>Garnish with a sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan cheese, a pinch of red pepper flakes if you like some heat, or some chopped fresh parsley.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with a side of warm, crusty bread for dipping into that incredible creamy broth.</li>
    </ol>
